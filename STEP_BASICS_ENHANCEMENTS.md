# Step Basic Enhancements: The Foundation of Luxury

For a villa app, "The Basics" shouldn't just be about bed counts. It's about establishing the **grandeur and setting** of the property.

Here are 4 recommendations to make Step 1 feel like a luxury villa onboarding:

## 1. "The Setting" (Context is King)
A map pin tells you *where* it is, but not *what it feels like*.
*   **New Section**: **"Describe the setting"** (Visual Grid)
*   **Options**:
    *   🌊 **Beachfront** (Direct access)
    *   ⛰️ **Cliffside** (Ocean views)
    *   🌾 **Rice Field / Jungle** (Nature retreat)
    *   🏙️ **Urban Oasis** (City center but private)
    *   🏔️ **Hilltop** (Panoramic views)
*   **Why**: This is often the #1 filter for villa seekers.

## 2. "Villa Architecture" (Style over Type)
Generic "House" or "Apartment" doesn't fit.
*   **Refine Property Types**: Replace the generic list with architectural styles.
*   **Options**:
    *   **Modern / Minimalist** (Glass, concrete, sleek)
    *   **Traditional / Heritage** (Joglo, wooden, cultural)
    *   **Mediterranean** (White stone, arches)
    *   **Tropical Open-Living** (Thatched roof, open walls)
*   **Why**: Guests book villas for the *aesthetic*.

## 3. "Estate Scale" (Size Matters)
Villas are defined by space.
*   **New Input**: **"Property Size"**
    *   Input for Land Area (m² / sq ft) and Building Area.
*   **Compound Layout**: Ask if it's a "Single Building" or "Pavilion Compound" (common in Bali/Thailand).

## 4. "Privacy & Exclusivity"
*   **Privacy Tag**:
    *   🛡️ **Gated Community**
    *   🏝️ **Standalone / Secluded** (No neighbors visible)
    *   👥 **Shared Grounds** (if applicable)

## Recommendation
I suggest implementing **#1 (The Setting)** and **#2 (Villa Architecture)**. These visual selectors will immediately make the app feel specialized for vacations rather than just "housing".
