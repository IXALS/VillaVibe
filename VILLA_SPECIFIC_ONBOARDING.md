# Villa-Centric Onboarding Enhancements

Since **VillaVibe** focuses on villas, the onboarding shouldn't just feel like a generic apartment rental. It should speak the language of **luxury, space, and service**.

Here are 4 high-impact recommendations to tailor the experience for Villa Hosts:

## 1. "Staff & Services" Step (The Luxury Touch)
Villas often come with a team. Standard Airbnb flows miss this.
*   **New Section**: After "Amenities", add a **"Staff & Services"** step.
*   **Options**:
    *   👨‍🍳 Private Chef
    *   🧹 Daily Housekeeping
    *   🛡️ 24/7 Security
    *   🤵 Butler / Villa Manager
    *   🚗 Driver / Airport Transfer
*   **Why**: This immediately signals "Premium" and sets expectations for high-value bookings.

## 2. "The Grounds" (Outdoor Focus)
For a villa, the *outside* is as important as the inside.
*   **Enhanced Amenities**: Split amenities into "Indoor" and "Outdoor/Grounds".
*   **Villa Specifics**:
    *   🏊 Infinity Pool (vs just "Pool")
    *   🌅 Private Beach Access
    *   🧘 Yoga Shala / Gazebo
    *   🎾 Tennis Court
    *   🔥 Fire Pit / BBQ Area
*   **Why**: Guests book villas for the outdoor lifestyle. Highlight it.

## 3. "Bedroom Configuration" (Suites vs Rooms)
Villas have "Master Suites", not just "Bedroom 1".
*   **Feature**: Allow hosts to tag bedrooms.
    *   *Example*: "Bedroom 1" -> "Ocean Master Suite" (King Bed + Ensuite + Balcony).
*   **Why**: Helps large groups (families/friends) plan who sleeps where.

## 4. "Curate the Vibe"
Villas are destinations in themselves.
*   **Vibe Tags**: Ask the host to select the primary "Mood" of the villa.
    *   🌿 **Zen/Retreat** (Quiet, secluded, nature)
    *   🎉 **Entertainer** (Sound system, open plan, large pool)
    *   👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Family Fun** (Fenced pool, playground, bunk beds)
    *   💻 **Digital Nomad** (High-speed fiber, ergonomic chairs)
*   **Why**: Helps match the right guest to the right property, reducing complaints (e.g., partying guests in a quiet retreat).

## Recommendation
I suggest we implement **#1 (Staff & Services)** and **#2 (The Grounds)** first. These are the biggest differentiators between a standard rental and a luxury villa.
